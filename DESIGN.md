# Design System: SmartFlow Digital

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
**Atmosphere**: Cinematic, Precise, Fluid.
The design balances technical "Logic" with aesthetic "Flow". It uses a dark, velvety charcoal background (#080c10 to #0a0a0a) to create depth, allowing vibrant accent colors to pop. The typography is a mix of geometric sans-serif (Space Grotesk, Inter) for structure and elegant serif/calligraphic fonts (Playfair Display) for "Flow".

## 2. Color Palette & Roles

### Cinematic Blue
- **Primary Blue (#2b8cee)**: High-energy accent for the Hero section. Used for buttons, active links, and glows.
- **Deep Logic Blue (#135bec)**: A more grounded, technical blue for the "Dual Craft" section.

### Neon Growth
- **Neon Green (#19e624)**: A high-contrast, modern accent for the "Portfolio" and "Finale" sections. Signifies wealth, growth, and digital energy.

### Core Tones
- **Velvet Charcoal (#081010)**: The base background color.
- **Silver Chrome (#71717a - #ffffff)**: Used for liquid metal effects and highlights.

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Structural Headers**: Space Grotesk / Inter (Black/ExtraBold). All-caps, tight tracking for a "Brutalist" technical feel.
- **Fluid Accents**: Playfair Display (Italic). Used for "Flow" or "Wealth" to contrast the rigidity of the code.

## 4. Component Stylings
- **Cards**: "Glass Panels" with `backdrop-blur-md` and a subtle `border-white/10`.
- **Buttons**: Rounded-lg or pill-shaped, using the primary accent color with a subtle glow.
- **Grids**: "Mesh Grid" (50px/80px) and "Swiss Grid" (dots) to reinforce the architectural concept.

## 5. Layout Principles
- **Asymmetrical Balance**: Heavy use of whitespace and non-standard grid placements to create a cinematic, non-templated look.
- **Fluid Storytelling**: Each part morphs into the next through scroll-triggered transformations.
